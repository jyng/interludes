      <p class="mbxl">We can stay up until 3:00 am for work or after a long night out, and we can wake at 5:00 am in anticipation for a long road trip. But 4:00 am, it's a strange tipping point. Our typical unconsciousness lends particular meaning to the rare events that do occur during this time. Are these experiences supposed to be as rare as being awake at 4:00 am? Here, we share what we've gathered from these times—connectivity, introspection, and peace—and how the thoughts can actually form the rest of our days.</p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="pass_the_pipe">VOL 004</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn pan">pass the pipe</h2>

         <p>My friends and I are strolling around a neighborhood, and there's a slight chill in the Los Angeles summer air. My mind is fighting intoxication from the day's activities. But sleep can wait; these moments cannot. After all, at what other time do I get the opportunity to see my friends as dazed as I am? This is when barriers cripple and we're more open to speak our minds about the thoughts that we don't (or won't) share during the day.</p>

         <p>We arrive at the university campus, surprising the security guard. It's a strange hour for visitors. The campus is now our playground. I take pictures of landmarks absent of the usual bustle of students. We took our seats near the communal fireplace and I pass the pipe to my friend.</p>

         <p>"How come you never visit home? Do you miss your family?"</p>

         <p>She looks down and lets out a deep sigh. I learn about her happiness, her bonds with others, and the struggle of that balance. I look off into the distance and softly respond, "I know how you feel."</p>

         <p class="mbxl">We often get caught up in the routine, feeling a little lost and losing sight of who we are. Something builds between all of us as we each take turns sharing perspectives. These are the moments that I live for.</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="a_script_for_solitude">VOL 004</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">a script for solitude</h2>

         <p>Melody drives into the parking lot. The tires didn't make it completely inside the lines, but she's already opening the door to the restaurant.</p>

         <p>The attendant's name tag says "Elisa." He does not look like a Elisa.</p>

         <p><b>Melody:</b> "May I get the grilled chicken burger? Sandwich only, please."</p>

         <p><b>Elisa:</b> "Do ya wanna try our-"</p>

         <p><b>Melody:</b> "No."</p>

         <p><b>Elisa:</b> "Okay. We'll call your number when your food is ready."</p>

         <p>His smile drops as she walks away.</p>

         <p>Melody sits at the biggest table in an uneven chair. This allows her to rock the chair profusely, so much that "Elisa" can't wait till his only customer left. Melody, however, is overjoyed that she is able to spend this time by herself. She is finally able to dissect whether she was really an extrovert or introvert. She could analyze why her friends meant more than her family. It was all so thrilling to her.</p>

         <p>"Grilled chicken burger", "Jocelyn" said.</p>

         <p>Melody sat back down and gazed into darkness as she chewed on her unnecessary nutrition. This was the hour where she could peel off her outer shell. She could sigh and no voice would ask her "What's wrong?". She could rock her uneven chair and no one would care. She lived for this moment. She didn't know what was important in life, but she yearned to find connection in her own consciousness.</p>

         <p class="mbxl">Melody finished her food, closed her eyes, and exhaled. Her stride to the car was slow and relecutant, but she knew that this precious hour was not forever. The engine started. Melody slipped back into her outer shell and drove into the morning.</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="being_awake_or_otherwise">VOL 004</a></h3>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">being awake, or otherwise</h2>

         <p class="mbxl">It's a rare pleasure to be awake before everyone else. At 4:00 am, the day begins with a vacuum. Whether or not my eyes open, the environment remains obscured, and the worries to which I fell asleep have not yet caught up to the new day. The mind is empty, uncluttered by the things past and those to come, a welcome relief from a routine, incessant consciousness. The anxiety, stress, and chronic everything of my every day often feels suffocating. I feel guilty yearning to escape, and I often contemplate my distance from reaching peace. At least at this hour, at this current distance, I don't concentrate on being awake. Nobody else is. But as with all times of day, this moment, too, passes. The volume of the world proceeds to dial in. The navy blue sky goes through its gradient, and the birds begin their symphony. I hear a rare car drive by and then the plop of a bundled newspaper in the driveway. The spell is broken.</p>

         <p>As uncommon as 4:00 am is, we also believe that this time hosts a multitude of experiences. How do you experience 4:00 am? We invite you, the reader, to contribute to this collection. Please send us an email! We are building a platform for all of our voices in expressing interludes. The site is in the works, and we're excited to have it ready for you to visit soon.</p>

         <p>Thanks for reading (and writing, maybe).</p>

         <p>Signed,</p>

         <p>Your friends at Interludes</p>
