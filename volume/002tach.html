            I had friends over for drinks, and we decided to play Pictionary. I usually opt out of these games, because I don't want to reveal my true self: someone that is incredibly bad at thinking on their feet. There is nothing more embarrassing and frustrating to me than receiving puzzled reactions to my performances. With some liquid courage, however, I thought it might not be so bad. <br>
            On my turn, my mind became as blank as the whiteboard in front of me. How in the world do I draw "myth"? I proceed to draw, but my friends were laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe. "What is that!?" I was given points solely for effort and entertainment.
