      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="spare_change">VOL 002</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn pan">spare change</h2>

         <p>I was at a cafe with a friend when an old man with an unkempt, grizzly beard edged himself inside and asked a group of people,</p>

         <p>"Please, guys, I just need two bucks for the bus. Can you give me something?"</p>

         <p>The four friends didn’t say a word to him. They shook their heads “no,” looked at each other, and then back at him. The situation proceeded to unravel our peaceful, privileged moment. With each passing minute, I felt my integrity being tested.</p>

         <p>We usually take care of our own responsibilities, and life is like clockwork. I forget that we share space with people, some who are in need and ask for help. I had a strong urge to hand him the money that he requested. Was it to remove the awkwardness and cease his begging? Or was it to truly help him out? My conscience was temporarily quelled by the thought that maybe someone else will take care of him.</p>

         <p>The barista yelled, "Hey! You gotta get out of here, man. Please leave. Have a good day." As the man departed, he yelled in response, "I just need money for the bus! You're an asshole, man."</p>

         <p>I found myself trying to look busy, staring back and forth between them and my phone. By not fully acknowledging the situation, I allowed myself to disregard it and rid myself of guilt. A part of me wants to believe that spare change isn’t something to be divided over. I don’t want to perpetuate the idea that we’re unsupportive of each other. I felt my façade deteriorate when the old man muttered, “Look at you guys, updating your statuses on twit-train, can’t even help someone out.”</p>

         <p class="mbxl">Later, I bought an overpriced $5 succulent, while sipping on my second cup of coffee.</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="we_shape_our_tools_and_our_tools_shape_us">VOL 002</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">we shape our tools, and our tools shape us</h2>

         <p>My father always pesters my mother about why she keeps buying notebooks. “Those are old and inefficient tools,” he would say while waving his tablet. I also wondered why my mother wrote in notebooks when she had her laptop.  “Well, there are some things that I need to write on paper,” she told me. There are many people like my mother who still rely on the process of handwriting. Pen and paper have been our default tools for expression, but will that still be true with the digital age?</p>

         <p>Typing is more reliable, legible, and faster than handwriting. But pens and papers have merits beyond inefficiency, because tools are more than pure utility. Hobbies like calligraphy or hand-lettering color the relationships that we have developed with writing tools. My father may pester about notebooks, but every night he practices Chinese calligraphy. The beauty in these tools becomes lost in the advent of their efficiency.</p>

         <p class="mbxl">Before the digital era sweeps away our pens and notebooks, let’s remember the beauty that they bestow us today.</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="vessels_for_my_memories">VOL 002</a></h3>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">vessels for my memories</h2>

         <p>My family memories are rooted in the sounds of chopsticks and porcelain rice bowls. The clinking surfaces rang reminders of the communal nature of eating. As I ventured into cuisines beyond Vietnamese home cooking, I became more adept at navigating with cutlery, cheese boards, huge dinner plates, wine glasses, and so ever on. I had an appetite for sampling everything, and I drew my accompanying friends into the memories along the way. In high school and college, portable food containers shaped our feasts. Potlucks celebrated new attempts to prepare sustenance for ourselves and for others. I loved the smiles that accompany people’s dishes. Friends became sheepish and self-conscious while unwrapping cellophane from their home-cooked food, lukewarm from the cooking pan hours ago. </p>

         <p class="mbxl">Now, at housewarming parties, I open drawers to new cutlery and kitchenware (often à la Ikea and Walmart), which remind me of my mother's cast iron pan, the surviving glass baking dish. I recall that decade-old hand mixer or the espresso maker employed each morning. I become excited by the memories anticipated to accompany these new vessels, still adorned with remnants of stickers. I imagine the meals to come, from the gregarious dinner gatherings to the solitary midnight snacks in front of a computer screen. Amid the memories of food and company, these objects, mere utensils and containers, are often the most enduring and well-used objects in our lives.</p>
