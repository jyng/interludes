      <p>If all the world's a stage, interludes are the stuff of pause and respite. These are the times when actors and actresses take a relieved breath, slouch, and perhaps chatter with those around, all before being swept again onto the next scene. This theatrical rhythm is not unlike that of reality. A personal interlude may be the last thirty seconds of the new year's countdown. It may be the solitary drive home after helping someone move into their freshman dormitory. At Interludes, we highlight the moments that fill the space between the (seemingly) monumental ones. By sharing these stories with you, we hope to cultivate greater consciousness of the smaller stories and how they frame the narration of our lives.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the first volume, and we hope you enjoy the read. Also, should you have any feedback, we welcome your voice through e-mail.</p>

      <p>Signed,</p>
      <p>Your friends</p>

      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn pan">the worth of words</h2>

         <p>We use language as conventional devices for our casual conversations. For instance, take a fancy word like &#8220;soir&#233;e,&#8221; which really just means &#8220;party&#8221; in French. A bathroom could also be called a restroom, wash closet, or lavatory. We even use the same conventional device to categorize people. We use the words &#8220;homeless&#8221; and &#8220;third world&#8221; to reference people and nations of lower stature. Is this what happens when we use words to describe conceptual issues?</p>

         <p class="mbxl">&#8220;Third world&#8221; insinuates that a country is on the lower end of a hierarchal system. This word then creates a subconscious mindset that is stationary. A better alternative would be &#8220;developing country&#8221; because all countries are theoretically working towards improving their communities. &#8220;Third world&#8221; suggests stagnancy whereas &#8220;developing country&#8221; suggests improvement. We are in a place of privilege to ponder the worth of our words. How can we challenge ourselves to move from pity toward cooperation and collaboration? Our unconscious word choices can be powerful frameworks to how we act upon our beliefs.</p>

      <h2 class="small di silver">VOL 001</h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">reaching bliss</h2>

         <p>Creative work involves a lot of failure married with vulnerability. If you're an optimist like me, you call that evolution. Donald Glover takes many risks in expressing himself through different creative outlets, progressing from the portrayal of humorous television characters to crooning over depression in music. He puts all of himself out there for us to see and experience. It has been exciting to watch this artist grow and be applauded for who he is and not what people want him to be. We have seen him evolve from &#8220;Bro Rape&#8221; (2011) to &#8220;Weirdo&#8221; (2011) to &#8220;Because the Internet&#8221; (2013). Throughout his early career, with the albums &#8220;Camp&#8221; and &#8220;Culdesac&#8221;, Glover was working out his voice and message. His later album, &#8220;Because The Internet,&#8221; was a different story. This album really encapsulated Glover&#8217;s emotional expression.</p>

         <p>When an interviewer once asked him how he does it all, he responded, &#8220;Whenever I do something, I always get really scared, but I&#8217;m also extremely excited and happy. That&#8217;s when I know [to take the opportunity].&#8221; This quote captures the small spark that I feel and want to keep when I embark on a new endeavor.</p>

         <p class="mbxl">Glover represents the power of transparent evolution. It took two albums for Glover to reach creative bliss with &#8220;Because the Internet.&#8221; This is the point at which an artist is able to express himself to the fullest extent. Shortly after &#8220;Because the Internet,&#8221; Glover disappeared entirely from the internet. There is no success story here, just human nature in constant action.</p>

      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">pause to play</h2>

         <p class="mbxl">Among our vast media landscape, one can find Vine, a video-sharing application self-described as &#8220;the best way to see and share life in motion.&#8221;
            The brevity featured by this mobile app is a tell of our generation&#8217;s attention deficit disorder. Yet, that doesn&#8217;t detract from how I manage to take away a renewed love for humanity after a particularly great video loop.
            I can find myself spending a few hours scrolling through life with the lens of Vine, especially at the end of tough days. A pause in my day allows me to press play on that of others.
            I laugh, I wait for the video to loop, and I laugh again. The greatest Vine producers condense content into the six-second loops with clever timing, editing, and wit, creating resonant and relatable moments that can range from parent-child interactions to hilariously candid accidents.
            It makes me realize how quickly human sentiments and situations can be crafted and then viewed. It doesn&#8217;t take much ― just six seconds ― and I&#8217;m tempted to remain forever in this respite.</p>
