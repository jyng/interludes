      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="infernal_affairs">VOL 003</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn pan">infernal affairs</h2>

         <p>During a lull in the history of Cantonese cinema, <i>Infernal Affairs</i> (2002) revived a movement that many believed would soon perish. This powerful film set a new standard for future Cantonese films, capturing audiences with its complex plot and supplemented with flashy action scenes.</p>

         <p>The English title glosses over the Chinese name, "无间道" (Mou Gaan Dou), which derives from a Buddhist philosophy that declares no inherent division in morality. It does not matter if you claim to be a good person; what matters is if you do good. The philosophy also recognizes that morality is in constant fluctuation. If a man steals from a bank today but saves a child tomorrow, what becomes of his morality?</p>

         <p class="mbxl">I had assumed that I was a good person for the majority of my life. No uncertainty at all. However, this movie wrangled my brain at night, and I began to realize the self-indulgence of claiming to be a good person. My good actions were motivated by the satisfaction of being a good person, as if every good deed increased points in my morality bank. Being a good person only meant that I felt good about it. As this statement plastered my forehead, I slowly drifted back to sleep. All of this stemmed from a single movie title. How many other titles will trigger my insomnia again?</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="drawing_courage">VOL 003</a></h2>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">drawing courage</h2>

         <p>I had friends over for drinks, and we decided to play Pictionary. I usually opt out of these games, because I don't want to reveal my true self: someone that is incredibly bad at thinking on their feet. There is nothing more embarrassing and frustrating to me than receiving puzzled reactions to my performances. With some liquid courage, however, I thought it might not be so bad.</p>

         <p>On my turn, my mind became as blank as the whiteboard in front of me. How in the world do I draw "myth"? I proceed to draw, but my friends were laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe. "What <b><i>is</i></b> that!?" I was given points solely for effort and entertainment.</p>

         <p class="mbxl">What the alcohol whispered to me was true; this experience wasn't so bad. By the second turn, every possible scenario of my friends' disapproval had faded. When it comes to insecurities, one way to understand it is to confront reality and experience it at first hand. When confronting my uncertainties, I can begin to unravel their roots and actually cope with the discomfort, as counterintuitive as it may be.  By not holding back, I've freed myself of the possibilities of what could have been and embraced what is.</p>

         <p></p>

      <h2 class="small di silver"><a name="hearing_my_mothers_laughter">VOL 003</a></h3>
      <h2 class="f2 f1-ns mtn">hearing my mother&#8217;s laughter</h2>

         <p>I could hear the television playing from down the hallway. Seinfeld has a distinctive type of babble. Among the canned laughter, my mother's would erupt every once in a while. Her laugh is unabashed, somewhat ugly but in the most honest way. I chuckle, and I return to reading my book or whatever was playing on my laptop.</p>

         <p>This scene resurfaces a mixture of joy, sadness, and discomfort for me. Many parents' lives are centered on the well-being and future of their children. Throughout my emerging adulthood, I take more notice of my mother's other dimensions: someone's high school teacher, a dating site profile, just another television viewer. I have no active role in these aspects of her life. Hearing my mother's laughter marks a deviation from the assumption that she'll be a part of my life forever. And the other assumption that I will be a part of her life forever.</p>

         <p class="mbxl">At least for this moment, I am in my space, while she is in hers, and all I want do is listen.</p>
