            The Worth of Words
         </p>
         <p class="content_story">
            We use language as conventional devices for our casual conversations. For instance, take a fancy word like “soirée,” which really just means “party” in French. A bathroom could also be called a restroom, wash closet, or lavatory. We even use the same conventional device to categorize people. We use the words “homeless” and “third world” to reference people and nations of lower stature. Is this what happens when we use words to describe conceptual issues? <br><br>
            “Third world” insinuates that a country is on the lower end of a hierarchal system. This word then creates a subconscious mindset that is stationary. A better alternative would be “developing country” because all countries are theoretically working towards improving their communities. “Third world” suggests stagnancy whereas “developing country” suggests improvement. We are in a place of privilege to ponder the worth of our words. How can we challenge ourselves to move from pity toward cooperation and collaboration? Our unconscious word choices can be powerful frameworks to how we act upon our beliefs.
