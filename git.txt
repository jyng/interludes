Alex’s Github Notes

When first accessing a repo

git clone <projectaddress>

Pushing code

git push <remote> <branch>
example: git push origin development

List All Branches
git branch -a

git fetch
Updates all my pointers?

git commit -m

git checkout <branch //switches my current branch

git merge <otherbranch> //merges OTHER branch with your CURRENT branch

git reset --hard  ///to reset to last commit


WORKFLOW
========
These are all examples and basic workflows, they can be modified to fit certain needs.

——————————————
To push a commit
————————————
git status      //review your changes and file statuses
git add -A .    //-A . command adds all files to the staging area. If this is not what you want, individually add files to the staging area.
git commit -m “MESSAGEHERE” //Commit changes with a useful message. example: git commit -m “Added file.css, modified file2.css, feature x still buggy”
git push origin <branch>    //push the specified branch that contains local commits to the server repo

————————————————
for merging development into master
———————————————————
(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)

git checkout master    
git pull origin master //pull latest code master (resolve merge conflicts if there are any)
git merge development  //merge development branch into master (happens in local repo, resolve merge conflicts if there are any)
git push origin master //push the merge to the server repo

———————————
Branching off into a new feature branch
—————

git checkout development          //checkout the most up to date branch
git pull origin development       //update the branch with the latest changes
git checkout -b <fb-newfeature>   //create a new branch which branches off the development branch
git push origin <fb-newfeature>   //push the branch to the server repo

——————————————
To grab the latest source code
———————————
git checkout development
git pull


How to rename a branch locally and remotely
===========================================
git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    
git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote
